# MobileOffload

This application was implemented realize a mobile application that performs local processing and also offloads computation (as well as storage) to a remote server. 
In particular, such an application shall extract the text contained in a source image through optical character recognition (OCR). 
The OCR service shall be provided by the remote server by using software containers. 
The project uses the Tesseract Open Source OCR Engine (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr) for the project.

Classes are separated in four groups: activities, with the actual activities of the application; fragments, 
basically with the fragment to handle the Facebook authentication; helpers, with several classes and methods to support the 
activities; and tasks, with the local and async tasks to run the OCR and communicate with the server.

All network traffic generated by the application is tunneled through an encrypted channel (Transport Layer Security). 
Self-signed certificates is used.
